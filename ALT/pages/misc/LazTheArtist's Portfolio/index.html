                        Okay, i translate it, but only for you english speaking guys... its [Lezly Gaming] or [Lazlo Gaming]... but mainly i use "Laz The Artist" for basically anything if its not hungarian stuff. <br>So please call me Laz, because its what i prefer instead of you trying to say/spell my name with your weird english accent :3<br>
                        Also im the founder/leader of MultiTeam, a Game Dev and Minecraft Modding team; which you can find <a class="text-link" href="../../../index.html">HERE</a><br>

                <div class="panle-content-text">
                        Im a (maybe) good artist, with 4 years of experience from working on different Games and Minecraft mods.<br>
                        As the time passed, i learned more and more. And because i was using Adobe Photoshop to make my textures, i was getting more and more interested in graphical design too, thats why this webpage is sooo beautiful.<br>
                        I mainly use Adobe programs, so im familiar (other than photoshop) with Premiere, After Effects, XD (this is not a text emoji, google it up) and not that much but Illustrator. Outside of Adobe, i have an expert certificate in Autodesk Autocad.<br>
                        Not mainly art related, but i can make websites, mainly html/css, but barely know javascript.<br>
                        One important thing to know about my art, is that i can adapt to any sytle. ANY STYLE!<br>
                        But i dont want to steal more time from you, lets see the examples of my Artwork:<br><br>
