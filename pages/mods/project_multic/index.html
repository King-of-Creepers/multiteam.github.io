Traveler, keep your eyes on this shiny orb, somewhen you will find out how to use it...</p><br>

			<h3>Better Sheep coloring</h3>
					<p>an old feature comes back: better sheep coloring. just like in bedrock edition, when you shears a sheep's wool, the leftover wool on the sheep stays colored.</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/sheepcolor.png">

						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/3dhook.png">
				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Item descriptions on the hud</h3>
					<p>from bedrock edition:
					<br>item descriptions and enchantments show up below the items name on the hud.(descriptions shows up, but not durabiliti or attack speed/attack damage)
					<br>-if the advanced tooltips are enabled (F3+H), the id will show up too</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/descriptionbrick.png">

			<h3>Bricks and stonebricks</h3>
					<p>a set of new block variants
					<br>-mossy bricks: just a mossy version of the normal bricks. good for decorations
					<br>-mycelic blocks: cobblestone, srone bricks and normal bricks. (mycelic? what dose that mean? they are infected with mycelium.) you can place mushroom on the mycelic blocks.
					<br>Crafting:
					<br>-the mossy brcik is a shapeless recipe, just 1 vine and a brick.
					<br>-the mycelic blocks are not being crafted. if you place a cobblestone/stonebrick/brick on the mycelium, after 6-10 seconds, it will turn into the mycelic version. if its happening in rain, it will take only 5 seconds (no more or less).</p>

			<h3>Debug-gui</h3>
					<p>this was shown at the minecon, and i need it as a feature:
					<br>-debug stick gui. its pretty self-explanatory. instead of always trying to figure out the controls of the stick, you can just simply right-click on a block that has stuff to change on it, and the gui opens.
					<br>(this image is from the live show, and iirc the fotage they showed is on bedrock, thats why the buttons looks like this. we will use the standard buttons)</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/debuggui.png">
				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Nether planting</h3>
					<p>Now using a golden hoe (only gold, others wont work) on soulsand creates soulsand framland. it will use lava to hydrate the farmland, and you can plant (later on the other new plants) the nether warts on it. from now, nether warts cant be placed on normal soul sand.
						lava hydrates the soulsand in a radius of 4 blocks, but only in the nether.
						in the overworld the radius decreses to 2 block
						additional: if you walk on the hydrated farmland, you get damaged. if you crouch you wont be damaged. just like magma blocks

						(the textures of the soulsand farmland block: there is only a new texture for the top. just like the normal farmland, the sides and the bottom will use the "source material" aka the soulsand texture)

						:ghost_pepper_addition: :exclamation_MT: [#0065b]
						If the ghost pepper mod is present, the pepper will only be plantable on the soulsand farmland</p>

				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Ghast plant</h3>
					<p>a very creepy plant, the ghastoid. its the "block version" of the Ghast tear seed.
					takes 8 minecraft days to grow fully (from stage 1 to stage 8)
					<br>Every stage has its drop:
					<br>stage 1: drops the seed back
					<br>stage 2: same
					<br>stage 3: it wont drop the seed back, so you just loose it.
					<br>stage 4-5: still dropps nothing
					<br>stage 6: when you broke it, it will spawn a ghast.
					<br>stage 7: drops (always) 1 ghast tear.
					<br>Stage 8 is a kind of corrupted form. the plant will become a ghast spawner. but these ghast will not drop tears or gunpowder, only some xp. if you break it, it will drop a seed with a chance of 20%.</p>
						<br><br>

				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Egg (semi)rework</h3>
					<p>Placeable eggs. from now, instead of throwing the eggs when you right click ,they should be placed as a block. this "new block" works like the sea pickles. its "stacks" in that block. (up to 4 eggs)
						they going to hatch in 20 minutes with 50% chance for a little chicken from each egg (each = if you have 3 eggs placed at once, each egg has a 90% chance to spawn a chicken when hatching)
						more behavior: adult chickens targets these placed eggs, and they going to stand "in the block" (they clip trough the block, like how the player does with the plants). if the player stands on them, they crack instantly (=vanish). If a adult chicken is "sitting" on the eggs, the birth chance increases to 80%/each egg

						This feature does not overwrites how the chickens lays their eggs. they still "dropps them on the ground"</p>

				<h3>Roses</h3>
					<p>the alpha release gave it, and then the 1.7 revoke it.... guess what it is: The rose. once upon a time, there was a release back then, and removed the rose, and replaced it with poppys... no its not a revenge, poppy stays. we just add the rose back alongside the poppy. and forget the phrase "roses are red, violets are blue", because they are coming in 6 variants, red, pink, blue, yellow, purple and white.

					<br>Generation:
					<br>-all of them: mixed in the flower forest biome
					<br>-red,pink,yellow: plains, forests
					<br>-blue, purple, white: cold biomes, like: taiga, mega taiga, snowy taiga, mountains</p>

			<h3>Plans and Upcoming features of Multicraft: Bee edition</h3>
					<p>Bee edition? Well, yes, this page will cover up all the plans for Multicraft 1.15.x<br>NOTE: only new features will be listed here.<br>All the current/planned features for 1.14.4 are going to be ported.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Beehive Gui</h3>
						<p>The beehive gui.
						<br>-it show the honey level in it, and you can take it when its full
						<br>-Shows the bees. exactyl:
						<br>there is 3 bee slots. the bee icon shows up when that slot is occupied (the icons are those big cute bee "heads").
						<br>next to them, you can see informations about the bees. i will go from top to bottom and left to right with explanation:
						<br>so one bee has 2 icons. the left one is always changing. if a bee is wandering and just does nothing, it shows no icon. if a bee hading towards a flower, it shows that "> Flower " icon. its a cornflower because thats my favorite flower. if a bee is being pollenated, and hading towards the hive, it shows that "< Flower" icon. the next one i explain is the right one. its a hive icon with either an X mark or a checkmark. it show when that be is being in the hive or flying outside. (checkmar=bee in, X=bee out).
						<br>and the last icon really depends on the previous: the honey comb icon. it appears almost everytime when a bee is inside the hive, and marks that the bee is making honey currently.
						<br>there should be a lock icon on the bottle input until there's a campfire under the hive so the player doesn't accidentally shift-click and get a bunch of bees following them.</p>
