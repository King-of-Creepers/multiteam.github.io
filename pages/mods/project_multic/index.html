				<h3>Ruby</h3>
				<a id="version_badge-114">1.14.4</a>
					<p>Yes, the diamond and emerald is enough... for the overworld... How about being in a new dimension? Ruby can be found in the nether ceiling (Not really high, but high enough). Just like the other gems it drops one item when mined, fortune works as well, and you can craft it into block form. Traveler, keep your eyes on this shiny orb, somewhen you will find out how to use it...</p><br>

						first set:
						if the player place a gunpowder into the first input slot, the "type buttons" will show up, and will display all possible fireworkcharge item in the game. you can hover over it, and will display the charge's infos in a form of a tooltip. and if you click on one of them, it will place the required items into the slots, if you have missing items, it will place the items in you have, but it will mark the missing items with red. like when you using the recipe book in crafting, but you have missing items.

						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/villagers.png">

			<h3>Redstone engineering table</h3>
					<p>The new tinkerer table for the new tinkerer villager. functionality coming soon.</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/engietable.png">
				<br><br><br>

						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/susstable.png">
				<br><br><br>

					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/suss.png">
				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Debug-gui</h3>
					<p>this was shown at the minecon, and i need it as a feature:
					<br>-debug stick gui. its pretty self-explanatory. instead of always trying to figure out the controls of the stick, you can just simply right-click on a block that has stuff to change on it, and the gui opens.
					<br>(this image is from the live show, and iirc the fotage they showed is on bedrock, thats why the buttons looks like this. we will use the standard buttons)</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/debuggui.png">
				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Nether planting</h3>
					<p>Now using a golden hoe (only gold, others wont work) on soulsand creates soulsand framland. it will use lava to hydrate the farmland, and you can plant (later on the other new plants) the nether warts on it. from now, nether warts cant be placed on normal soul sand.
						lava hydrates the soulsand in a radius of 4 blocks, but only in the nether.
						in the overworld the radius decreses to 2 block
						additional: if you walk on the hydrated farmland, you get damaged. if you crouch you wont be damaged. just like magma blocks

						(the textures of the soulsand farmland block: there is only a new texture for the top. just like the normal farmland, the sides and the bottom will use the "source material" aka the soulsand texture)

						:ghost_pepper_addition: :exclamation_MT: [#0065b]
						If the ghost pepper mod is present, the pepper will only be plantable on the soulsand farmland</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/netherplanting.png">
				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Ghast plant</h3>
					<p>a very creepy plant, the ghastoid. its the "block version" of the Ghast tear seed.
					takes 8 minecraft days to grow fully (from stage 1 to stage 8)
					<br>Every stage has its drop:
					<br>stage 1: drops the seed back
					<br>stage 2: same
					<br>stage 3: it wont drop the seed back, so you just loose it.
					<br>stage 4-5: still dropps nothing
					<br>stage 6: when you broke it, it will spawn a ghast.
					<br>stage 7: drops (always) 1 ghast tear.
					<br>Stage 8 is a kind of corrupted form. the plant will become a ghast spawner. but these ghast will not drop tears or gunpowder, only some xp. if you break it, it will drop a seed with a chance of 20%.</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/ghatsplant.png" style="max-width:700px;height:100px;">
				<br><br><br>
			<h3>Egg (semi)rework</h3>
					<p>Placeable eggs. from now, instead of throwing the eggs when you right click ,they should be placed as a block. this "new block" works like the sea pickles. its "stacks" in that block. (up to 4 eggs)
						they going to hatch in 20 minutes with 50% chance for a little chicken from each egg (each = if you have 3 eggs placed at once, each egg has a 90% chance to spawn a chicken when hatching)
						more behavior: adult chickens targets these placed eggs, and they going to stand "in the block" (they clip trough the block, like how the player does with the plants). if the player stands on them, they crack instantly (=vanish). If a adult chicken is "sitting" on the eggs, the birth chance increases to 80%/each egg

						This feature does not overwrites how the chickens lays their eggs. they still "dropps them on the ground"</p>
						<br><br>
					<img draggable="false" id="content_image" src="images/plans/eggz.png" style="max-width:700px;height:100px;">
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Roses</h3>
					<p>the alpha release gave it, and then the 1.7 revoke it.... guess what it is: The rose. once upon a time, there was a release back then, and removed the rose, and replaced it with poppys... no its not a revenge, poppy stays. we just add the rose back alongside the poppy. and forget the phrase "roses are red, violets are blue", because they are coming in 6 variants, red, pink, blue, yellow, purple and white.

					<br>Generation:
					<br>-all of them: mixed in the flower forest biome
					<br>-red,pink,yellow: plains, forests
					<br>-blue, purple, white: cold biomes, like: taiga, mega taiga, snowy taiga, mountains</p>
						<br><br>

				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Ender-Trip</h3>
					<p>The idea of a thing called Ender trip come into my mind around 2018. but i never made a plan or concept for it, so it never had a chance to become a thing.
					<br>but now, i got bored and i made a concept. so whats this, and how it works:
					<br>There is a chance for it to happen: when its dark, and there is no light around you, the 3 block tall space is present (u know, endermen.) it just happens. as shown in the video, an enderman will grab you, and then "teleport". yes this veird tunnel thingy is what endermen usually see when they teleport. also the end island is just a visual, they never will place you down there. the tunnel i think could be done via shaders. The tunnel is kinda a semi-dimension, because it not happens in the overworld, but i dont really know how it really works. when traveling, the player takes damage. not much, same damage comes from the tunnel as from cactuses. IF the player dies here, its inventory's contents spread between the start point (where the enderman grabbed the player) and the end point (where the endermen started to teleport. wich could be 2 block away, or anywhere within the vanilla teleport range, wich is as i... or the wiki remembers is 32 blocks) have fun finding your stuff, steve!
					<br>in the video, it shows the enderman from a thrid person look. you can go to third person while teleporting, but default is first person. the video dosent shows the arriving, but you can imagine. just like it teleported there.</p>

			<h3>Plans and Upcoming features of Multi Expansion: Bee edition</h3>
					<p>Bee edition? Well, yes, this page will cover up all the plans for Multi Expansion 1.15.x<br>NOTE: only new features will be listed here.<br>All the current/planned features for 1.14.4 are going to be ported.</p>
				<br><br><br>
				<h3>Beehive Gui</h3>
				<a id="version_badge-115">1.15.2</a>
						<p>The beehive gui.
						<br>-it show the honey level in it, and you can take it when its full
						<br>-Shows the bees. exactyl:
						<br>there is 3 bee slots. the bee icon shows up when that slot is occupied (the icons are those big cute bee "heads").
						<br>next to them, you can see informations about the bees. i will go from top to bottom and left to right with explanation:
						<br>so one bee has 2 icons. the left one is always changing. if a bee is wandering and just does nothing, it shows no icon. if a bee hading towards a flower, it shows that "> Flower " icon. its a cornflower because thats my favorite flower. if a bee is being pollenated, and hading towards the hive, it shows that "< Flower" icon. the next one i explain is the right one. its a hive icon with either an X mark or a checkmark. it show when that be is being in the hive or flying outside. (checkmar=bee in, X=bee out).
						<br>and the last icon really depends on the previous: the honey comb icon. it appears almost everytime when a bee is inside the hive, and marks that the bee is making honey currently.
						<br>there should be a lock icon on the bottle input until there's a campfire under the hive so the player doesn't accidentally shift-click and get a bunch of bees following them.</p>
						<br><br>

				<h3>Beehive and nestst Honey levels</h3>
						<p>So... the hives and nests alredy has honey level, huh? Indeed, but the plan is that all the five levels should have its texture.<br>Credits for the texture: IAmGama</p>

				<h3>Enchanting book</h3>
						<p>This new item is a book. and it does nothing when right clicked with or anything else. just exists.
						<br>-it randomly generates in witch huts (if there is no chest in the witch huts, then place one in) with a quantity of 2-3
						<br>-its being required to craft enchantment tables. this item replaces the normal book in the recipe of the enchanting table. from now on, its a bit more harder to make one.</p>

				<h3>Wrench</h3>
						<p>Here is the introduction of the wrench. i was thinking on a wrench like tool since multicraft 1.12, but i couldn't find any use for it until now. first i put here the wrench item, those awesome features will come later.it will somewhat function like a survival-compatible-debugstick</p>
