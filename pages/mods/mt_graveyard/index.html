			MultiCraft
					<div id="panel-content">
					<br>Phase 1 - Multicraft-OldAlpha (1.11.2)<br>
					<br>MultiCraft is the oldest mod of the team. Multicraft-OldAlpha is the first version that existed, from 2017.Q1 (around february) to 2017.Q3 (around september) It was created with Mcreator, and the basic idea was to add features to the game that are useful, community wants it, or at some point some mod had it but the mod hasnt been updated. IamGama did most of the textures, and i (Lezly_Gaming aka King of Creepers) made it into the game with mcreator. The cheese item in the 1.12.2 (Beta Multicraft) version, and the flute item from 1.14.4 (Multicraft) version was originated from here.<br>

					Phase 2 - Beta MultiCraft (1.12.2)<br><br>
					This phase has the longest lore, because this one has the longest lifetime. Started in 2017.Q4 (around november) and ended in 2018.Q3 (around in july). At this point of development i started believeing this mod has a good future, but hings turned dark very soon. The development started on 1.12.2 this time with proper coding and not mcreator, entirely coded by Lukas. I mainly done textures, sometimes IamGama helped with them. The first public was released on 2018.jan.14th on curseforge. Back in 2017 i recruited Monstahh to work on the mod, because Lukas was alone. Later Lukas decided to stop working on the mod because he lost his interest in it. Monstahh as a helper coder wasnt enough to work on the mod alone. Here comes in SkyHawk, the second main coder of multicraft. He started working on the mod, around this time came the third and fourth release of the mod. But things changed. back in the time, i havent bought the game yet, so i used a cracked version. This made skyhawk Quit working on the mod.
					In 2019 february, there was a try to revive the mod, this time AwakenedRedstone took the place of a leader coder, but it wasnt a long lasting thing.<br>

					Phase 3 - MultiCraft (1.14.4)<br><br>
					This phase started in 2019 august, and still going on to this day. A new main coder, Rellit was recruited to work on the mod, but this time he was the only coder. Now everything was slow, because Rellit had not much time, but the mod started to become a thing, now on the (at that time) the newset version, 1.14.4. Later on MaroonShaded was recruited to help push the mod forward alongside Rellit. the first version released in 2020 januray, but due to the slow development the next version just aproaching now in june.<br>

					Phase 4 - MultiExpansion (1.15.2)<br><br>
					This phase is a very interesting section, its not history, instead these are future plans. So, why the name change? because we figured out that a server managment thing is called multicraft, but unfortunatly they choosed this name first. The updated name comes paired with a version update to 1.15.2, as well as bee related features to the mod.
