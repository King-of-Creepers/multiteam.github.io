			<div class="texttype2">
					Im a (maybe) good artist, with almost 3 years of experience from working on different Minecraft mods.<br>
					As the time passed, i learned more and more. And because i was using Adobe Photoshop to make my textures, i was getting more and more interested in graphical design too, thats why this webpage is sooo beautiful.<br><br>
					But i dont want to steal more time from you, lets see the examples of my Artwork:
