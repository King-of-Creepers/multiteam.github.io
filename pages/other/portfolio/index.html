		<div class="texttype1">My Artwork:</div>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
			<div class="texttype2">
					Im a (maybe) good artist, with almost 3 years of experience from working on different Minecraft mods.<br>
					As the time passed, i learned more and more. And because i was using Adobe Photoshop to make my textures, i was getting more and more interested in graphical design too, thats why this webpage is sooo beautiful.<br>
					One important thing to know about my art, is that i can adapt to any sytle. ANY STYLE!<br>
					But i dont want to steal more time from you, lets see the examples of my Artwork:
