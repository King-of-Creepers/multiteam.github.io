					You can mess with my name little fellas, i dont really care. <br>
					Okay, i translate it, but only for you english speaking guys... its [Lezly Gaming] or [Lazlo Gaming]... but mainly i use "Laz The Artist" for basically anything if its not hungarian stuff. <br>So please call me Laz, because its what i prefer instead of you trying to say/spell my name with your weird english accent :3<br>
					Also im the founder/leader of MultiTeam minecraft modding group, which you can find here: <a class="texttypelink" href="https://king-of-creepers.github.io/multiteam.github.io/index"><u>Link</u></a><br>
					You still want more of me? Here you go.. Im a 17 year old boy from <a class="texttypelink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungary"><u>Hungary</u></a> who just likes to create stuff.<br>
					But dont let this all trick you, im in middle school, where i study electronic engineering. Yes, i never studied art/graphic design, but im still good at it.

		<div class="texttype1">My Artwork:</div>
				<div class="spacer"></div>
			<div class="texttype2">
					Im a (maybe) good artist, with 3 years of experience from working on different Minecraft mods.<br>
					As the time passed, i learned more and more. And because i was using Adobe Photoshop to make my textures, i was getting more and more interested in graphical design too, thats why this webpage is sooo beautiful.<br>
					I mainly use Adobe programs, so im familiar (other than photoshop) with Premiere, After Effects, XD (this is not a text emoji, google it up) and not that much but Illustrator. Outside of Adobe, i have an expert certificate in Autodesk Autocad.<br>
					Not mainly art related, but i can make websites, mainly html/css, but barely know javascript.<br>
					One important thing to know about my art, is that i can adapt to any sytle. ANY STYLE!<br>
					But i dont want to steal more time from you, lets see the examples of my Artwork:
